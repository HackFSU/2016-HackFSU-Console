			.title-separator
			.two_third.last Each year, we set out to build a culture of creation. Students put aside their weekend for the opportunity to build whatever they can think of alongside hundreds of other students from around the country. Mentors from the industry volunteer their knowledge to support your crazy ideas. All we ask is that you come prepared with an open mind, ready to dedicate thirty hours to learn something new. 
			
			.two_third.last See you there, <br/> The HackFSU Crew
