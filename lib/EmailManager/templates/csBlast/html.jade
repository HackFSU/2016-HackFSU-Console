Team sizes are capped at four attendees and you will use the time to learn as much as you can and build anything you can think of. We are busing in students from all over Florida and the South East which means there will be plenty of people looking for a team or idea.<br>

We will be providing you with plenty of mentors and the perfect environment to learn as much as you can in the 30 hours. Most students are surprised with what they can make at their first hackathon. Just ask any of our students from
